# PYCHARM-SIMULATION
# README: Memory Allocation Visualization

This C program demonstrates memory allocation using different allocation algorithms (First Fit, Worst Fit, Best Fit) for multiple programs within the same free memory segment. The program visualizes the memory allocation process using matplotlib in Python.

## Features
- **Memory Allocation Algorithms**: The program includes modified versions of First Fit, Worst Fit, and Best Fit allocation algorithms to allocate memory blocks to programs efficiently.
- **User Input**: Users can input the number and sizes of free memory segments and programs to visualize the allocation process.
- **Visualization**: The program uses matplotlib to create bar graphs showing the allocation of memory blocks to programs based on the selected allocation algorithm.

## How to Use
1. Run the program and input the required information:
   - Number of free memory segments.
   - Size of each free memory segment.
   - Number of programs.
   - Size of each program.
2. The program will visualize the memory allocation using First Fit, Worst Fit, and Best Fit algorithms.
3. Each bar graph represents the memory blocks, free memory segments, and allocated programs.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib library

## Files Included
- `memory_allocation_visualization.py`: The main Python script for memory allocation visualization.
- `README.md`: This readme file providing information about the program.

## Modification
Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs or integrate it into your projects. You can customize the colors, add more allocation algorithms, or enhance the visualization further.
